# Van_Houck Hard Modding Tutorial

Author: [Van_Houck](https://forums.crateentertainment.com/u/Van_Houck)

Today I learned of a method for “hard modding” Grim Dawn without actually doing so. This is a lot simpler than my method, so I wanted to share it here too.

Doing this allows one to play this (or any, actually) mod with main campaign characters, avoiding having to start over or porting them over.

## 1. Download the mod

Download the mod, extract it, and choose the version you want to play.

## 2. Go to the database folder

Go to the database folder and rename the *.arz file to database.arz.

## 3. Go to the resources folder

Go to the resources folder and rename the Maps.arc file to Levels.arc.

## 4. Copy the .arz file

Copy the .arz file from the database folder, as well as all .arc files from the resources folder, over to the "Grim Dawn/mods" folder. It should look like this (not shown are the eventual expansion and survival folders):

## 5. Launch the Mod

* If on Steam, right-click Grim Dawn inside your Library > Properties > Add /basemods to Launch Options
* If you are using Grim Internals, right-click GrimInternals64 > Create shortcut > right-click GrimInternals64 - Shortcut > Properties > Add /basemods to the end of Target (behind the ")
* If you are using the GOG version, do the same as above but with the Grim Dawn.exe

Then you are done!
